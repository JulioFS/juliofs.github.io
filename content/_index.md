Howdy, my name is Julio Flores Schwarzbeck, a full-stack software developer.

I am also a GenX-er who started programming in the mid-80's and haven't stopped ever since. I enjoy dynamic web application development, microservice-oriented API design and implementation, using web technologies.

I specialize in Python, HTML5/JavaScript ES6, Salesforce Apex, LWC and Mobile Web applications, and prefer working on POSIX compliant operating systems such as MacOS and Linux, currently switching between MacOS and Fedora Linux for day-to-day
operations.(

I am also an avid (yet by no means expert) woodworker and DIY-er and lately specializing in building miniature log cabins,
which will be highlighted on this application.

On this web page, I have two _tracks_, the _tech_ one and the _woodworking_ one, hoping you find the content usefule and
entertaining.

Here are your Pills: [Tech] - [Wood]
