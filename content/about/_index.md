### Professional

I have a BS in Systems Engineering and have worked from incredibly awesome start-ups to the formal mighty financial industry, on hands-on, pure, unadulterated web and full-stack application development.

For some time now, I've been working with Salesforce (Apex/LWC development), and have to say I never expected that
I was going to enjoy Java as much as I am, working on my _double star ranger_ rank on Salesforce's trailhead.

I am currently employed working as an Application Development Tech Lead at a financial advisory firm in Camas, WA. USA.

### Personal

I love to code. I learnt Python around 2000, and alongside HTML5+ and JavaScript technologies it became my passion. I've also been a Linux user for decades, and feel more at home writing Open Source software.

I also tutor coding (Check learncoding.rocks) for HS kids, college students and adult folks.

### Contact

I don't participate much in social media currently, I'd very much like building, rather than consuming technology, especialy mainstream type. But in any case, I sometimes lurk around on BlueSky and Reddit.
