title: 'Dumb AI'

Seriously, is AI helping in any way other than being an annoying collection of _smart_ (debatable) decision collections???

Coding speaking, _Copilot, Agentforce_, etc, are, to me, like an annoying child that though smart, wants
to embed his crap in everything you're doing, yes, sometimes is is useful, specially when you want
to include some _boilerplate code_, or want to illustrate a fibonacci algorithm, or a non-recursive
factorial method in python, and so on.

But some of us work on real applications with real **business requirements** and no amount of _AI_ will
make our code work the way we **really** wanted, don't even get me started with code completion, it is utter crap, seriously,
I think the AI marketing plot is one created by semi-technical idiots that hate real developers, in order
to piss us off and give (non-technical) management a reason to explain their exploded licensing budget for AI.

First thing I do in VS Code (my default IDE) is to disable these mostrosities and regain a bit of sanity.

Sure, "_.. Hey, ChatGPT, create a one page summary of the importance of the wrath of Achilles from the Illiad poem .._",
or "_.. Hey OpenAI, resume the 3-hour audio file from my professor (from the class I missed) into a bulletpoint paragraph .._",
that kind of thing, but please, stay away from coding.
